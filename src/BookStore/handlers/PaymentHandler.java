     * - usePoints indicates whether to redeem points first before using balance.

     * Modifies: customerâ€™s points, balance, and stored file data.
     * Effects:
     * - If points fully cover the cost, deduct points only.
     * - If points partially cover the cost, deduct remaining cost from balance.
     * - If not enough points + balance, transaction fails.
     * - Awards 10 points per $1 spent from balance.
